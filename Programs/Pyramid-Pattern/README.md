## How to Use

1. Compile the program using a C compiler (e.g., gcc).
2. Run the compiled executable.
3. Enter a sequence of numbers when prompted.
4. The program will display a pyramid pattern using the entered numbers.

## Algorithm

The program follows the following algorithm:

1. Prompt the user to enter a sequence of numbers.
2. Determine the length of the input sequence.
3. Use nested loops to iterate through the input numbers and print a pyramid pattern.
4. Print each row of the pyramid, starting from the current position in the input sequence.

## Example

If the user enters "12345" as input, the program will output:

> 12345
> 2345
> 345
> 45
> 5
