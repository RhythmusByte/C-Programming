# Pyramid Number Pattern Program

This C program takes user input to create a pyramid pattern with numbers.

## Algorithm

The program follows the following algorithm:

```
Pyramid Number Pattern Program Algorithm:

1. Prompt the user to enter a sequence of numbers.
2. Determine the length of the input sequence.
3. Use a nested loop structure:
   a. Outer loop (i) iterates from 0 to the length of the input sequence.
   b. Inner loop (j) iterates from the current outer loop index (i) to the end of the input sequence.
   c. Print the current number in the inner loop.
   d. Move to the next line after each inner loop iteration.
4. The program will generate a pyramid pattern using the entered numbers.

Example Output (for input "12345"):

12345
2345
345
45
5

```
