Scientific Calculator Program Algorithm:

1. Display a menu with options for different mathematical operations.
2. Take user input for the chosen operation.
3. Use a switch-case structure to perform the selected mathematical operation:
   a. Prompt the user for input values if necessary.
   b. Perform the mathematical operation using functions from the math library.
   c. Display the result of the operation.
4. Repeat the process until the user chooses to exit.

Supported Operations:
- Square Root
- Square
- Power
- Modulus (Absolute Value)
- Percentage
